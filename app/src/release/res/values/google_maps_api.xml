    TODO: Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To do this, you can either add your release key credentials to your existing
    key, or create a new key.

    Note that this file specifies the API key for the release build target.
    If you have previously set up a key for the debug target with the debug signing certificate,
    you will also need to set up a key for your release certificate.

    Follow the directions here:

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/signup

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=E4:70:8D:8B:96:ED:7D:54:BC:D8:75:CF:45:AC:7D:C7:63:B2:CC:FE%3Bcom.example.vartikasharma.splashscreen

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    E4:70:8D:8B:96:ED:7D:54:BC:D8:75:CF:45:AC:7D:C7:63:B2:CC:FE

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    E4:70:8D:8B:96:ED:7D:54:BC:D8:75:CF:45:AC:7D:C7:63:B2:CC:FE

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
